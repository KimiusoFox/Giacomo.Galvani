                <p class="lead mb-5" style="font-weight: bold;">üëã Hi there!</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    I‚Äôm Giacomo Galvani, and the best way I can define myself is as ‚Äúimaginative.‚Äù This term might not be exact, but I believe it conveys the idea: someone who constantly imagines alternate realities, fantastical worlds just beyond sight, and 
                    explores the implications of the darkest corners of the human mind, every hour, minute, and second of his life üß¨. 

                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Throughout my existence, I‚Äôve always had the desire to create something of my own, whether it be a video game, an animated short, or a novel. I‚Äôve followed this passion relentlessly, pursuing every opportunity to bring my ideas to life. 
                    My love for storytelling was cemented at the age of 17 after watching Porco Rosso üêΩ by Hayao Miyazaki. With teary eyes at the end of the movie, I decided to devote my life to creating emotions as powerful as the ones I felt in that moment. From that point on, my marriage to storytelling was inevitable.
                </p>
                
         <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Stories speak to humans in a way no other form of communication can. 
                    They live within us, shape how we see the world, and help us fully understand ourselves.
                    I stand by what Robert McKee said in his most famous book Story üìñ: ‚ÄúA fine work 
                    of art‚Äîmusic, dance, painting, story‚Äîhas the power to silence the chatter in the mind 
                    and lift us to another place.‚Äù
                </p>

                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    üß† I have an instinctive creativity that I often need to reign in, as it can lead me in many directions. However, this is also one of my strengths, as it allows me to quickly construct multiple narrative paths, revealing the key elements needed to ensure the storytelling achieves the desired impact. 

                </p>

                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    ‚úçüèª I specialize in crafting complex psychological and physical dynamics, focusing on characters and situations with unsettling or disturbed elements, creating emotionally charged narratives that resonate deeply with audiences.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    üî• I love my work, down to every microscopic detail. I don‚Äôt just put my body into what I do, but my soul as well. I'm eager to learn from everyone I collaborate with, expanding my knowledge a little more every day.

                <div class="subheading mb-3">A diary from the early 1800s, following a young adult's journey across Europe...</div>
                <p>
                    Theodor Friedrich S√§ngler was an artist who never achieved this title in his lifetime. His work was discovered
                    in a small northern Italian village bookstore, marking the start of my journey with this bizarre and grim creation.
                    I'm translating, adapting, and reconstructing what seems like an unfortunate third Grimm brother, or perhaps a precursor.
                    This diary, in addition to recounting Theodor‚Äôs peculiar journey, is also a collection of fairy tales, fables, and
                    legends‚Äîall written or adapted by him from his travels. The diary's pages are filled with doubts, fears, weaknesses, and
                    horrors, alongside a sharp narrative sense‚Äîan outcry against a world that never ceases to strike. As Theodor
                    writes: "The Great Flood led to the complete eradication of mankind, sparing only Noah and his family. Even the
                    beasts, except for a pair of each species, were wiped out. Corruption can seep into the creatures with whom we 
                    share this earth, turning them into victims of those who delight in sin. I write these words to understand the
                    devastation I witnessed at the beginning of my journey. I must reclaim reason, make sense of the evil, and ultimately 
                    exorcise my mind. [...] On foot, away from madness, I head toward my goal. I write to purge what‚Äôs in my mind and 
                    transform these disturbing thoughts."
                </p>

    After the fourth turn, it can no longer hunt me: Is it wise to mock the unknown, to challenge it merely for the thrill?
         In this story of certainty and defiance, the answer becomes unmistakably clear.

    A Loving Man: A short story inspired by the Italian crime news of the last years...

A man full of love is a man who can endure anything. 
The most important thing is that this love should not be questioned or, even worse, mistreated. 
                A tale of obsession, where the boundaries of affection and insanity blur.

                <p>
                    This is my work for the startup Ethicode (Ethicode is a startup that merges programming and digital learning with
interactive storytelling to engage and educate children effectively in
Responsible Technology Use). Inside, you will find my approach to accessible storytelling, primarily aimed at children and pre-teens. These texts are designed to raise awareness about responsible use of mobile phones and the internet. To do so, I took one of the most widely played video games‚ÄîMinecraft, which attracts players from various age groups‚Äîand used my knowledge of its world to create plausible stories within Minecraft‚Äôs world-building, while extending and adapting certain limits to highlight key concepts and adventures.

Below, you'll find a link to part of my work. The first section includes a linear story developed across several chapters. Later on, you'll encounter a shift towards self-contained episodes, each focusing on specific aspects of digital education.
