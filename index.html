                <p class="lead mb-5" style="font-weight: bold;">üëã Hi there!</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    I‚Äôm Giacomo Galvani, and the best way I can define myself is as ‚Äúimaginative.‚Äù This term might not be exact, but I believe it conveys the idea: someone who constantly imagines alternate realities, fantastical worlds just beyond sight, and 
                    explores the implications of the darkest corners of the human mind, every hour, minute, and second of his life üß¨. 

                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Throughout my existence, I‚Äôve always had the desire to create something of my own, whether it be a video game, an animated short, or a novel. I‚Äôve followed this passion relentlessly, pursuing every opportunity to bring my ideas to life. 
                    My love for storytelling was cemented at the age of 17 after watching Porco Rosso üêΩ by Hayao Miyazaki. With teary eyes at the end of the movie, I decided to devote my life to creating emotions as powerful as the ones I felt in that moment. From that point on, my marriage to storytelling was inevitable.
                </p>
                
         <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Stories speak to humans in a way no other form of communication can. 
                    They live within us, shape how we see the world, and help us fully understand ourselves.
                    I stand by what Robert McKee said in his most famous book Story üìñ: ‚ÄúA fine work 
                    of art‚Äîmusic, dance, painting, story‚Äîhas the power to silence the chatter in the mind 
                    and lift us to another place.‚Äù
                </p>

                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    üß† I have an instinctive creativity that I often need to reign in, as it can lead me in many directions. However, this is also one of my strengths, as it allows me to quickly construct multiple narrative paths, revealing the key elements needed to ensure the storytelling achieves the desired impact. 

                </p>

                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    ‚úçüèª I specialize in crafting complex psychological and physical dynamics, focusing on characters and situations with unsettling or disturbed elements, creating emotionally charged narratives that resonate deeply with audiences.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    üî• I love my work, down to every microscopic detail. I don‚Äôt just put my body into what I do, but my soul as well. I'm eager to learn from everyone I collaborate with, expanding my knowledge a little more every day.

                        I am part of a vibrant collective of artists‚Äîillustrators, writers, and animators‚Äîunited by our shared passion for the comic arts. We self-produce our works, including the anthology "Life, Death, and Birds." 
                        Currently, I‚Äôm contributing two stories for our next anthology, collaborating closely with talented illustrators.
                        This experience has deepened my understanding of comic self-publishing and the synergy between text and image, reinforcing how powerful visual storytelling can be in tandem with written narratives.

                        Through this, I developed a strong understanding of using storytelling to communicate morals and ethical dilemmas.
                        Collaborating closely with psychologists, I optimized narratives for psychological impact, which improved 
                        my work and deepened my awareness of the powerful influence storytelling can have on the human mind.

                        startup's lifecycle, from its early stages to the official launch with paying customers and contracts with 
                        businesses, which gave me a deeper understanding of the effort required to achieve even the smallest success.
                        This experience sharpened my project management skills, teaching me the importance of staying calm, pragmatic, and
                        maintaining clear, steady communication with team members and external collaborators.

    The Lost Diary of Theodor S√§ngler
                      </h3>

                        <div class="subheading mb-3">a diary from the early 1800s, following
                            a young adult's journey across Europe in search of stories...
                        </div>
                        <p> Theodor Friedrich S√§ngler was an artist who never achieved this
                            title in his lifetime. His work was discovered in a small northern
                            Italian village bookstore, marking the start of my journey with this
                            bizarre and grim creation. I'm translating, adapting, and reconstructing
                            what seems like an unfortunate third Grimm brother, or perhaps a precursor.
                            This diary, in addition to recounting Theodor‚Äôs peculiar journey, is also a
                            collection of fairy tales, fables, and legends‚Äîall written or adapted by him from 
                            his travels. The diary's pages are filled with doubts, fears, weaknesses, and horrors, alongside
                            a sharp narrative sense‚Äîan outcry against a world that never ceases to strike.
                            As Theodor writes: "The Great Flood led to the complete eradication of mankind, sparing only
                            Noah and his family. Even the beasts, except for a pair of each species, were wiped out.
                            Corruption can seep into the creatures with whom we share this earth, turning them into
                            victims of those who delight in sin. I write these words to understand the devastation 
                            I witnessed at the beginning of my journey. I must reclaim reason, make sense
                            of the evil, and ultimately exorcise my mind. [...] On foot, away from madness, I head toward my goal.
                            I write to purge what‚Äôs in my mind and transform these disturbing thoughts."</p>

<div>This Post-Diploma Screenwriting Course specialized in storytelling techniques. The program 
    covered key aspects of narrative design, including plot development, character creation, world-building, and
    dialogue writing tailored for sequential art. Throughout the course, I developed multiple scripts, exploring 
    a variety of genres and styles, while collaborating with illustrators to understand the interaction between 
    text and visual elements. I also learned to pitch narrative projects, structure stories for different
    formats (one-shot, series), and adapt screenwriting principles to the unique constraints of comic book panels 
    and pacing.</div>
